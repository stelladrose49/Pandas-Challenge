    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- In general, schools with larger budgets did not produce better test results. In contrast, schools spending between $645 and $675 per student performed worse than those with smaller budgets (specifically, $585 per student).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall, small and medium-sized schools significantly outperformed large schools in terms of math pass rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On my school summary section where we are supposed to create a DataFrame called `per_school_summary` with columns for the calculations, I was unable to solve why it kept returning my output as ValueError: 2. So unfortunately, all of my data following this step either returned errors or came out looking different than I was expecting. I was still able to write the code that I know is supposed to go in those spots, but the outputs for them are showing incorrect because of my incomplete DataFrame per_school_summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- In conclusion, charter schools excelled in comparison to public district schools in all aspects. Nevertheless, additional analysis is required to discern whether this performance disparity is a result of school practices or stems from the fact that charter schools generally serve smaller student populations per school.\n",
